## Overview

**Satyrs** are male nature spirits from Greek mythology, depicted as having **human upper bodies** combined with the **legs, hooves, tail, and horns of goats**. They are companions and followers of **Dionysus**, the god of wine, revelry, and ecstasy.

Satyrs are characterized by their **hedonistic behavior**, including:
- Excessive wine-drinking and drunkenness
- Playing music (particularly pan flutes)
- Ecstatic dancing
- Pursuing nymphs with lustful abandon

They represent uninhibited natural instincts, fertility, and wild sexuality. Famous satyrs include **Pan** (though often considered a god) and **Silenus**, the foster father and tutor of Dionysus.

In Greek theater, **satyr plays** were a comic dramatic form featuring choruses of satyrs, performed after tragic trilogies. The Romans had a similar but distinct creature called the **Faun**. In Christian tradition, satyrs were demonized and their goat-like appearance influenced depictions of devils and Satan.
