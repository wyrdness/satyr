Famous satyrs include **Pan** (though often considered a god) and **Silenus**, the foster father and tutor of Dionysus. In Greek theater, **satyr plays** were a comic dramatic form featuring choruses of satyrs, performed after tragic trilogies. The Romans had a similar but distinct creature called the **Faun**. In Christian tradition, satyrs were demonized and their goat-like appearance influenced depictions of devils and Satan."
