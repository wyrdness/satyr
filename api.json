      "full": "Satyrs are male nature spirits from Greek mythology, depicted as having human upper bodies combined with the legs, hooves, tail, and horns of goats. They are companions and followers of Dionysus, the god of wine, revelry, and ecstasy. Satyrs are characterized by their hedonistic behavior, including excessive wine-drinking, playing music (particularly pan flutes), dancing, and pursuing nymphs with lustful abandon. They represent uninhibited natural instincts, fertility, and wild sexuality. Famous satyrs include Pan (though often considered a god) and Silenus, the foster father and tutor of Dionysus. In Greek theater, satyr plays were a comic dramatic form featuring choruses of satyrs. The Romans had a similar but distinct creature called the Faun. In Christian tradition, satyrs were demonized and their appearance influenced depictions of devils and Satan with goat-like features."
